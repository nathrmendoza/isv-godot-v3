This malevolent predator uses its hypnotic gaze to paralyze prey and unleash devastating psychic attacks. Agile and relentless, it slithers through darkness, striking swiftly from shadows. Its shimmering scales reflect faint light, making it eerily mesmerizing yet terrifying as it stalks the unwary. Only the bravest dare face the Oculus Serpentis."
